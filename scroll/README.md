# scroll

A scroll progress indicator widget for [gio](https://gioui.org).

## Origin

~whereswaldon developed a view-only version of this for [sprig](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/sprig), and
~jackmordaunt contributed support for clicking within the scroll tray
area and for dragging the indicator to move it. We agreed that the
feature was generally useful and have pulled it out of the sprig
repository so that other gio users can benefit.

## Status

This repository does not have a stable API. Pin yourself to a particular version
with go modules.

## Example

See the `example` folder for a simple program demonstrating how to use the scroll bar.

## License

Dual Unlicense/MIT, same as Gio
